# NijiGPen: Blender Grease Pencil Add-on

[[ üìñ Documentation ](https://chsh2.github.io/nijigp/)] | [[ üé• YouTube Demos ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEgTVZ2uBvPMM0sGzzQTyoV0or8_PTs6t)]

NijiGPen is a [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) add-on that brings new features to Grease Pencil for creating 2D graphic design and illustrations. It provides with the following functions:

- 2D algorithms for vector shapes and strokes (e.g., Boolean and Offset)
- Refinement and cleanup of hand-drawn 2D strokes
- Conversion from 2D shapes to 3D meshes
- Data exchange with other painting/designing tools

Please note that the development of this add-on is still in an early stage. Bugs may exist and UI/operators may change frequently.

## Installation

Requirement: Blender 3.3 or later
